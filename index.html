				<h3>Fingers</h3>
				<p>Your index finger is your first finger, middle finger is your second finger, ring finger is your third finger, and your pinky is your fourth finger. <br> I’m sure this seems simple to you, but when you begin reading chord diagrams, scale diagrams, tabs, and sheet music, you’ll need to know which finger to use right away.</p>

				<h3>Fret</h3>
				<p>The frets on the guitar are the metal strips placed along the fretboard. <br>The first fret is the metal strip closest to the headstock of the guitar, and then it counts up from there.</p>

				<h3>Strings</h3>
				<p>Most people think the string closest to them, the thickest string, is the first string of the guitar, but it’s actually the opposite. The string closest to the floor, the thinnest string, is the first string. <br>The next string up, the second thinnest string, is the second string, and so on from there. Just be aware that your thinnest string is the first string, and the thickest string is the sixth string.</p>

				<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
				<p>Take as much time as you need to get comfortable with all three systems by testing yourself, looking at tabs, and studying chords diagrams. <br>Remember that knowing these systems really well will make all the other guitar lessons in the Beginner Guitar Quick-Start Series a lot faster, along with any other lessons you take later on.</p>
